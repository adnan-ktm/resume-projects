My personal GitHub repository contains my learnings of various algorithms and compiling their Big Oh and Big Omega. 

I have demonstrated my ability to understand data structures like arrays, linkied list and hashmaps. Other concepts covered include- Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, SQL DDL/DMLs and setting up of pipelines. I keep updating the repo, with my new findings to demonstrate my technical understanding.
