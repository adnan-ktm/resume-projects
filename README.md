My personal GitHub repository contains my learnings of various algorithms and compiling their Big Oh and Big Omega. I have demonstrated my ability to understand data structures like binary trees, arrays, stack, and linked lists. Other concepts covered include- Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, JDBC connections and setting up of pipelines. I keep updating the repo, with my new findings to demonstrate my technical understanding.
